Data Science: Refers to the umbrella of techniques where you are trying to extract information and insights from data. 

Data Mining: Pefers to the science of collecting all the past data and then searching for patterns in this data. 
            You look for consistent patterns and / or relationships between variables. 
            Once you find these insights, you validate the findings by applying the detected patterns to new subsets of data. 
            The ultimate goal of data mining is prediction - and predictive data mining is the most common type of data mining and one that has the most direct business applications.

Data Analysis: Predictive modelers. Any attempt to make sense of data can be called as data analysis.

Machine learning - is the science of creating algorithms and program which learn on their own. 
    Once designed, they do not need a human to become better.
