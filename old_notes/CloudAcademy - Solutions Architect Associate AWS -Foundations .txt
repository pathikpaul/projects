Specifically designed to prepare you for the AWS certification, the Cloud Academy Certified Solutions Architect learning path has helped thousands of students master the AWS Solution Architect Associate certification. Built around the domains of the exam blueprint this learning path includes over 30 hours of interactive content 8 video courses and 18 hands on labs carefully blended with summary check points, chalk talks, cue cards, exam tips. This learning path contains over 5 quiz sessions plus a final exam readiness assessment to help get you prepared for sitting the certification exam. 

AWS Foundations: Compute, storage, and services. Learn the core AWS compute, storage, and service offerings you need to be familiar with for the AWS Solutions Architect–Associate exam

Domain one: Designing highly available, cost efficient, fault tolerant, scalable systems. Teaches you to recognize and explain the core architecture principles of high availability, fault tolerance, and cost optimization. We then step through the core AWS components that can enable highly available solutions when used together so you can recognize and explain how to design and monitor highly available, cost efficient, fault tolerant, scalable systems.

Domain two: Implementation/deployment. Learn to apply the design principles, components, and services we learned in the previous courses in this learning path to design and build a highly available, scalable application. We then apply our optimization principles to identify ways to increase durability and cost efficiency to ensure the best possible solution for the end customer.

Domain three: Data security: learn to recognize and explain platform compliance for AWS, and be able to both recognize and implement secure procedures for optimum cloud deployment and maintenance, including understanding the shared responsibility security model, and knowing what that looks like in practice.

Exam preparation: Exam primer, study session, test session. A final exam primer, exam tips and readiness assessment to help get you prepared for sitting the certification exam. Once you have completed the courses, labs, and quizzes, take the 30-minute primer at the end and download the flash cards to help you prepare for sitting the exam. 

With this learning path, you will have everything you need to learn, build, and test your knowledge so you'll be ready to demonstrate that you can effectively design and manage application infrastructure using Amazon Web Services. Once you have completed the courses, labs, and quizzes, take the 30-minute primer at the end of the learning path to help you prepare for sitting the exam.
