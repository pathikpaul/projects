Fast . AI ---- Not Coursera - Jeremy Howard

- anyone can do machine learning 
- Not using tenserflow 
- it is amazon

	Top Down 
	First teaches programming
	Then the theory

Udacity - deep learing course
	- they don't teach you a lot
	- they expect a lot from your 
	- lots of pre requisites
	- 5 Projects
	- jupyter notebook
	- Is it free ???


courera - deep learning 
	- updated
	- uses all the latest technologies
	- python / numpy
	- tenserflow

coursera - mcahine learning
	- do the course in python nympy instead
	- types of problems
		- variance
		- classification

What is machine learning  (Supervised / UnSupervised)
	Arthur Samuel
	Tom Mitchell
		E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
		T = the task of playing checkers.
		P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

Learning Algorithms
Introduction Supervised Learning
	Supervised Learning => Give it dataset with expected results
		Regression Problem (numeric o/P .. continuous)
		Classification Problem ( two or more possible outputs)
			Inputs = Features (infinite number of features)
			Outputs = Labels
		
Introduction UnSupervised Learning
	Input = dataset .. but no results provided
	Clustering 
		news.google.com grouping news articles
		grouping people based on the genetic code
		social network analysis
		market segmentation
	Octave is free version of matlab	

Model and Cost Function
	h = hypothesis = Model
		univariate linear regression (one I/P one O/P)
		y = c + mx
	Cost function = squared error function
Parameter Learning : Gradient Descent
